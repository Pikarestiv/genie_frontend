          party organisation. The information we receive from other
          organisations depends on your settings or the option responses you

        <p>
          4.when you use our website: information about you is recorded and

        </p>

        <h4>How we use your information</h4>

        <p>
          We will use your personal information in a number of ways which
          reflect the legal basis applying to processing of your data. These may
          include:
        </p>

        <p>providing you with the information or services you have asked for</p>

        <p>
          sending you communications with your consent that may be of interest,
          including marketing information about our services and activities
        </p>

        <p>
          when necessary, for carrying out your obligations under any contract
          between us
        </p>

        <p>
          seeking your views on the services or activities we carry on, so that
          we can make improvements
        </p>

        <p>
          maintaining our organisational records and ensuring we know how you
          prefer to be contacted
        </p>

        <p>
          analysing the operation of our website and analysing your website
          behaviour to improve the website and its usefulness
        </p>

        <p>processing job applications</p>

        <h4>Use of Aggregated Data</h4>
        <p>
          Where Data can be aggregated (and anonymised), we may use this for
          research purposes without restriction.
        </p>

        <p>
          For example, we may monitor customer traffic patterns, Site and
          Services usage and related information in order to optimise users’
          usage of the Site and Services and we may give aggregated statistics
          to a reputable third-party.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are entitled to do this because the resulting data will not
          personal identify you and will therefore no longer constitute personal
          data for the purposes of data protection laws.
        </p>

        <h4>Our legal basis for processing your information</h4>
        <p>
          The use of your information for the purposes set out above is lawful
          because one or more of the following applies:
        </p>

        <p>
          where you have provided information to us for the purposes of
          requesting information or requesting that we carry out a service for
          you, we will proceed on the basis that you have given consent to us
          using the information for that purpose, based on the way that you
          provided the information to us. You may withdraw consent at any time
          by emailing us at [email]. This will not affect the lawfulness of
          processing of your information prior to your withdrawal of consent
          being received and actioned;
        </p>

        <p>
          it is necessary for us to hold and use your information so that we can
          carry out our obligations under a contract entered into with you or to
          take steps you ask us to prior to entering into a contract;
        </p>

        <p>it is necessary to comply with our legal obligations.;</p>

        <p>
          where the purpose of our processing is the provision of information or
          services to you, we may also rely on the fact that it is necessary for
          our legitimate interests in relation to providing the information or
          service requested, and given that you have made the request, would
          presume that there is no prejudice to you in our fulfilling your
          request;
        </p>
        <p>
          where the purpose of our processing is to protect the vital interests
          of the individual concerned or other individuals.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want to contact us about your marketing preferences, please
          contact [email]
        </p>

        <h4>Who has access to your information?</h4>
        <p>
          Third parties who provide services for us, for example sending
          mailings, billing etc. We select our third party service providers
          with care. We provide these third parties with the information that is
          necessary to provide the service and we will have an agreement in
          place that requires them to operate with the same care over data
          protection as we do
        </p>
        <p>
          Third parties if we run an event in conjunction with them. We will let
          you know how your data is used when you register for any event
        </p>
        <p>
          Analytics and search engine providers that help us to improve our
          website and its use
        </p>
        <p>
          Third parties in connection with restructuring or reorganisation of
          our operations, for example if we merge with another business. In such
          event, we will take steps to ensure your privacy rights will be
          protected by the third party
        </p>
        <p>
          Owing to matters such as financial or technical considerations, the
          information you provide to us may be transferred to countries outside
          the European Economic Area (EEA), which are not subject to the same
          data protection regulations as apply in the UK. We meet our
          obligations under GDPR by ensuring that the information has equivalent
          protection as if it were being held within the EEA. We do this by
          ensuring that any third parties processing your data outside the EEA
          either benefits from an adequacy determination for GDPR purposes
          and/or, where appropriate, we have entered into a data processing
          agreement which contains model EU clauses.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may also disclose your personal information if we are required to
          do so under any legal obligation and may use external data for the
          purposes of fraud prevention and credit risk reduction, or where doing
          so would not infringe your rights, but is necessary and in the public
          interest.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other than this, we will not share your information with other
          organisations without your consent.
        </p>

          do so by contacting us at [email].

        <h4>Cookies</h4>
        <p>
          In addition to the information which you supply to us, information and
          data may be automatically collected through the use of cookies.
          Cookies are small text files employed on the Site to recognise repeat
          users and allow us to observe behaviour and compile aggregate data in
          order to improve the Site for you. For example, cookies will tell us
          whether you viewed the Site with sound or with text on your last
          visit. Cookies also allow us to count the number of unique and return
          visitors to our Site. Some of our associated companies may themselves
          use cookies on their own websites. We have no access to, or control of
          these cookies, should this occur.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cookies may be either “persistent” cookies or “session” cookies. A
          persistent cookie consists of a text file sent by a web server to a
          web browser, which will be stored by the browser and will remain valid
          until its set expiry date (unless deleted by the user before the
          expiry date). A session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the
          end of the user session, when the web browser is closed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The law states that we can store cookies on your machine if they are
          essential to the operation of the Site, but that for all others we
          need your permission to do so.
        </p>
        <p>The list below explains the cookies we use and why:</p>
        <p>Opting out of cookies</p>
        <p>

          you should be able to turn cookies off on your web browser: please
          follow your browser provider’s instruction in order to do so.
          Unfortunately, we cannot accept liability for any malfunctioning of
          your PC or its installed web browser as a result of any attempt to
          turn off cookies.
        </p>

          periodically ask you to renew your consent.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you ask us to stop contacting you with marketing materials, we will

        <p>
          We always aim to improve the services we offer. As a result, we
          occasionally canvass our customers using surveys (where the customer
          has opted in for this). Participation in surveys is voluntary, and you
